The game community continues to grow and embraces stakeholders with broad interests. There are games for entertainment, serious games, and gamified applications. Entertainment games, for example, are a thriving industry with over two billion players around the world; this industry generates over 120 billion in revenue every year. However, today's large-scale games have many challenging development issues. They are complex, can take years to develop, and rely on teams with expertise spanning artistic, computer science, software engineering, and business skills. Games have demanding traditional quality of service requirements (e.g., performance, reliability, scalability, usability). They also have distinct user experience requirements to provide players with a game that is engaging and fun.

The interdisciplinary games and software engineering research community investigates game development issues from the perspectives of traditional engineering (e.g., requirements engineering, design, testing) and umbrella (e.g., lifecycle processes, configuration management, traceability) activities. In addition, topics including metrics, re-use, data analytics, user experience, and so on are also explored. Software engineering approaches are essential to support the rapid, cost-effective development of high-quality games. FASE4Games'24 provides a forum to explore issues that crosscut the software engineering and game development communities. 

## Theme and Topics

Game developers share a common community of interest: how to best engineer game software. They focus their attention on entertainment market opportunities, game-based applications in non-entertainment domains such as defence, education, healthcare, and scientific research (i.e., serious games), and the gamification of applications to improve engagement. This workshop seeks contributions from academic researchers and commercial game developers, addressing topics that span the emerging and current research challenges in the areas including, but not limited to:

* Automated requirements engineering methods for games.
* Automated software architecture and design methods for games.
* Automated generation and modding of games.
* Automated software testing for games, including usability and playtesting.
* Automated model based representations, analyses, and transformations (forward, reverse).
* Automated monitoring, analysis, and visualization of game play data acquired from large scale games.
* Automated machine learning techniques applied to game development.
* Automated adaptation of game play.
* Automated workflows/processes for game development (e.g., Agile, DevOps).
* Automated configuration management, traceability, and build methods for game development.
* Tools, infrastructure, and services supporting automated game development methods.

## Submission

All submissions will be refereed by three members of the program committee. Accepted submissions will be published in the conference electronic proceedings and in both the ACM Digital Library and the IEEE Digital Library.

Submissions are accepted as follows:
* Long research papers (8 pages)
* Short research papers (5 pages)

Submissions must follow the  [FSE 2024 research track submission instructions](https://2024.esec-fse.org/track/fse-2024-research-papers#how-to-submit) using the *ACM Proceedings Template*. Note that the names and ordering of authors in the camera ready version cannot be modified from the ones in the submitted version.

<!-- At the time of submission, each paper should have no more than 18 pages for all text and figures, plus 4 pages for references, using the following templates: Latex or Word (Mac) or Word (Windows).  -->

Authors using LaTeX should use the `sample-acmsmall-conf.tex` file (found in the samples folder of the acmart package) with the `acmsmall` option. We also strongly encourage the use of the review, screen, and anonymous options as well. In sum, you want to use: `\documentclass[acmsmall,screen,review,anonymous]{acmart}`. 

<!-- Papers may be submitted using numeric citations, but final versions of accepted papers must use the author-year format for citations. It is a single-column page layout. Submissions that do not comply with the above instructions will be desk rejected without review.  -->

FaSE4Games'2024 requires that at least one author on each accepted paper will register for, and attend, the workshop, and give a presentation on the results.

**Papers submission is via EasyChair: TBA**
